# MyContacts - The Ultimate Contact Hoarder üéØ

## Basic Details
### Team Name: Nginx

### Team Members
- Team Lead: AaronKurian - Model Engineering College

### Project Description
A sophisticated contact management system that lets you meticulously organize and hoard contact information like a digital pack rat. Because apparently storing contacts in your phone wasn't complicated enough!

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People were living peacefully with their simple phone contact lists, blissfully unaware that they needed a full-stack web application with JWT authentication, protected routes, and a sleek black UI just to store their friend's phone numbers.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We've created an enterprise-grade contact management system with user authentication, CRUD operations, search functionality, and a beautiful dark theme. Now you can finally manage your 5 contacts with the power of MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js!
